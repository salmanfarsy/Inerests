<h1 class="myhead">Interest in Games</h1>
<p class="text">From my childhood I was fond of playing video games and specially Pc games.But I always had a low-end Pc so I played The games that ran on my pc So not many Triple A titles. And to be honest the soul purpose of getting a pc was to play video games So it was always one of my favourite hobby. But I Liked video games because You can see the result of your hard work in real time. When in the real world you always dont get the expected result of hard work. So video game was a great way to escape into another world. Although I was never really an expert in most of the games.</p>
