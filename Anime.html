<h1 class="head">Interest in Anime</h1>
<p class="text">Anime changed the away i viewed cartoons.The anime was an opening to a whole new world . It wasnt that generic cartoons . it was much more.It really took story telling to another level.And its not just for kids.there contents for everyone.although I didnt even know i was watching anime without even knowing it.I came to realize later that a whole medium of exciting story telling was out there which was very good at delivering what was expected of it.</p>

                <p>
                    I would say the world's best thriller 
                    not just anime but the best show ever made. a chase of cat
                    and mouse. and also it makes you question what is true
                    justice. i would highly recommend to watch it. as This
                    will be the best anime for me.

                My first action anime. with insane power ups. and out of this world fights
                . also with some of the most memorable characters. this is one of the

                   A simple story of a outcast boy and his dream to be admired by all.
                   but the story also is about modern ninja. which changed the view of
                   ninja's forever.

                <p>
                   The best comedy show for me. although it has some vulgar scenes and dialouge
                   but for me this is very funny . and for the record this is the best
                   comedy anime of all time.and it also had a great storyline. overall its a 
                   great experience.

                   You wanna see a hero struggling to be the best? well then this show is not
                   for you. because it turn that concept on its head. the hero wins every 
                   fight without breaking a sweat. will there be a villain who could defeat
                   hero.

                <p>
                    This is typical show about a boy without super powers
                    becoming the best hero of the world. for the most parts its very enjoyable 
                    to watch the hero grow with other people around him. and also has some
                    of the epic moments to be remembered. so fairly good enough.

                   If i could delete the fillers this would have been a great show . but
                   it was filled with too many fillers . still the first arc was the best part of
                   the show . and also the captain of the thirteen squad are the main 
                   enjoyment for me.

                    Well i would say this is my first anime. and i didnt even know it
                    was anime. a simple show for kids. i watched it like 600+ episodes.
                    and i enjoyed most of it. although i cant say the same now.

                <h1>Attack on Titan</h1>
                <p>
                   The most epic anime ever made . 
                   this anime deserves its own genre and own theatre to be watched.
                   its a masterpiece unlike anyother. the true brillence of a good story
                   adapted perfectly for the short runtime.there is always more than what 
                   meets the eyes.
