      <h1>Itzy</h1>
     
      <p> A fairly new group .
         but took the world by storm. 
         Where most debut group’s popularity fall 
         after first year it didn’t happened for them. 
         They even made a bigger impact on the kpop industry in the second year.
          Their first song to get my attention was Icy. 
          And their favourite member for me is Yezi but 
          I think not just for itzy but for any group. 
          And they promote the idea of its okay to be different.</p>
